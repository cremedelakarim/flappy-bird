# 🐦 Flappy Bird Mania! 🚀

Get ready to flap your way to glory (or hilarious crashes!) with this classic Flappy Bird game, built with Phaser! 🎮

## 🌟 Features

*   Classic Flappy Bird gameplay: Tap to flap, dodge those pesky pipes!
*   Score tracking: Beat your own high score!
*   Dynamic backgrounds: Watch the scenery change as you progress!
*   Smooth animations and crisp pixel art.
*   Sound effects for that extra *oomph*! 🔊

## 🛠️ Getting Started: Let's Get Flapping!

Follow these simple steps to get the game running on your local machine and start your flapping adventure:

### 1. 📥 Download the Game Files

*   **Option A: Clone the Repository (Recommended for Developers)**
    If you have Git installed, open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cremedelakarim/flappy-bird.git
    cd flappy-bird
    ```

*   **Option B: Download ZIP**
    1.  On the GitHub repository page, click the green "Code" button.
    2.  Select "Download ZIP".
    3.  Once downloaded, unzip the file to a location of your choice.

### 2. ⚙️ Install Dependencies (The Engine Room!)

This game uses Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its bits and bobs. If you don't have them, you'll need to install them first.

*   **Install Node.js and npm:** Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system. Npm comes bundled with Node.js.

Once Node.js and npm are ready:
1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the game's root directory (the one with `package.json` in it).
    ```bash
    # Example: If you cloned or unzipped to a folder named "flappy-bird-game"
    cd path/to/flappy-bird-game
    ```
3.  Install the necessary packages by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the project's dependencies. It's like gathering all the birdseed! 🌾

### 3. ▶️ Run the Game (Lift Off!)

We use a handy tool called Vite (which is set up in `package.json`) to serve the game locally in your browser.

1.  In the same terminal, while still in the game's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  This command will start a local development server. You'll see a message in your terminal, usually something like:
    ```
    VITE vX.X.X  ready in XXX ms

    ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
    ➜  Network: use --host to expose
    ```
3.  Open your favorite web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
4.  Go to the `Local` address shown in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`).
5.  🎉 **Woohoo!** The game should load, and you're ready to start flapping!

### 🕹️ How to Play

*   **Tap the screen** or **press the Spacebar** to make the bird flap its wings.
*   Navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes.
*   Each successful pipe pass earns you a point.
*   Don't hit the pipes or the ground, or it's game over! (But don't worry, you can always restart 😉)
