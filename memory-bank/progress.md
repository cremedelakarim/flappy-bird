# Progress

## What Works
– Planning documents created.
– Project repository initialized (Git).
– Basic folder structure (assets/, src/, styles/) created.
– Chosen game framework (Phaser) and dev server (Vite).
– Installed Phaser and Vite dependencies.
– Basic HTML (index.html), JS (src/main.js with Phaser setup), and CSS (styles/main.css) files created.
– NPM scripts for Vite configured.
– Baseline game loop with blank background and FPS counter implemented.
– Asset loader stub (preload function) and generic State Machine skeleton integrated.
– Placeholders for game asset loading defined in code, and code updated to reference standard asset keys.
– Basic game canvas rendering with placeholder background and ground implemented.
– Bird character with placeholder appearance (or standard key), gravity, flap, and basic collision (ground/top) implemented.
– Pipe obstacles with placeholder appearance (or standard key), spawning, movement, and collision with bird implemented.
– Scoring system with current score and session high score display implemented.
– Input handling refined for consistent tap/click/spacebar for game states.
– Game Over screen enhanced with clearer score display and delayed restart.

## What's Left to Build
Mostly complete with placeholder graphics:

• Project scaffolding & build pipeline (Initial setup done, basic Phaser/Vite configured)
• Game loop + state machine (Basic Phaser game loop and state machine skeleton in place)
• Bird entity & physics (Implemented with placeholder/standard key graphics and basic flap/gravity)
• Pipe generation & pooling (Implemented with placeholder/standard key graphics, basic movement, and collision)
• Collision detection (Bird with ground, top, and pipes implemented)
• Score tracking & UI overlays (Implemented, Game Over screen enhanced)
• Input handling (mouse, touch, keyboard) (Refined for game states)
• Asset integration (graphics, sounds) (Code prepared for asset files, actual files needed)
• Deployment pipeline

## Current Status
Day 0 – groundwork. Core gameplay mechanics and UI flow are functional with placeholder graphics. Code is prepared for actual asset files. Game Over screen is enhanced.

## Known Issues
None – development not started.
