# Progress

## What Works
– Planning documents created.
– Project repository initialized (Git).
– Basic folder structure (assets/, src/, styles/) created.
– Chosen game framework (Phaser) and dev server (Vite).
– Installed Phaser and Vite dependencies.
– Basic HTML (index.html), JS (src/main.js with Phaser setup), and CSS (styles/main.css) files created.
– NPM scripts for Vite configured.
– Baseline game loop with blank background and FPS counter implemented.
– Asset loader stub (preload function) and generic State Machine skeleton integrated.
– Placeholders for game asset loading defined in code, and code updated to reference standard asset keys.
– Basic game canvas rendering with placeholder background and ground implemented.
– Bird character with placeholder appearance (or standard key), gravity, flap, and basic collision (ground/top) implemented.
– Pipe obstacles with placeholder appearance (or standard key), spawning, movement, and collision with bird implemented.
– Scoring system with current score and session high score display implemented.
– Input handling refined for consistent tap/click/spacebar for game states.
– Game Over screen enhanced with clearer score display and delayed restart.
– Actual game assets (sprites and audio) integrated. Bird has flapping animation and sounds are played for flap, score, hit, and game over events. The wing sound now plays on every flap. Menu background music implemented for menu states, respecting browser autoplay policies.
– Pipe rendering improved: top pipes are inverted, all pipes connect visually to screen edges using dynamic \`displayHeight\` (preserving hitboxes), and pipe pair spacing is consistent, preventing overlaps.
– Implemented sprite-based scoreboard using individual digit images for current score and high score. Score display is now always on top and features a celebration animation for multiples of 10.
– Gameplay music implemented: "game_start.mp3" plays at game start (skipping the first 4 seconds), "second_level.mp3" at 20 points, and "third_level.mp3" at 40 points. Music transitions smoothly (cross-fades) and stops on game over.

## What's Left to Build
Mostly complete:

• Project scaffolding & build pipeline (Initial setup done, basic Phaser/Vite configured)
• Game loop + state machine (Basic Phaser game loop and state machine skeleton in place)
• Bird entity & physics (Implemented with placeholder/standard key graphics and basic flap/gravity)
• Pipe generation & pooling (Implemented with actual graphics, correct rendering, spacing, and collision)
• Collision detection (Bird with ground, top, and pipes implemented and verified)
• Score tracking & UI overlays (Implemented, Game Over screen enhanced, sprite-based score implemented)
• Input handling (mouse, touch, keyboard) (Refined for game states)
• Asset integration (graphics, sounds) (Completed with actual sprites and audio, including score digits and multiple gameplay music tracks)
• Deployment pipeline

## Current Status
Core gameplay mechanics, rendering, sound effects (including dynamic gameplay music), and UI flow are functional with actual game assets. Pipe rendering and spacing issues are resolved. Bird animation is implemented. The scoreboard has been upgraded to use sprite-based digits and is always visible during gameplay. Next focus is on thorough testing and then deployment.

## Known Issues
None currently. Previous pipe rendering/spacing issues are resolved.
