Here's a detailed roadmap for developing a browser-based game featuring the specified game mechanics. Follow these steps to organize your development process and implement the game mechanics effectively.

## Roadmap.md

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Initialize a new project directory.
- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate, if needed.
- Create a base file structure for organization, including folders for assets, scripts, and styles.

### Step 2: Choose a Development Framework or Library
- Research and choose a suitable HTML5 game development framework or library (e.g., Phaser, Three.js, or PixiJS) that supports 2D game development.
- Install necessary tools and dependencies as per your framework choice.
- Set up a basic HTML page that includes the framework/library.

### Step 3: Design Game Assets
- Create or source the bird sprite, pipe sprite, background images, and other necessary visual elements.
- Design a sprite sheet for the bird’s animation (flapping wings) if needed.
- Ensure all assets are saved in appropriate formats and organized within your project directory.

### Step 4: Implement Basic Game Canvas
- Create an HTML canvas element where the game will be rendered.
- Set up the canvas in your JavaScript file, initializing the framework and preparing it for rendering.

### Step 5: Develop the Bird Character
- Implement the bird’s appearance and basic physics (gravity and upward movement on input).
- Program the bird’s movement logic, including upward velocity when an input is detected (e.g., tap, click).
- Integrate the bird's flapping animation via a sprite sheet or sequence of images.

### Step 6: Create and Manage Obstacles
- Develop a system to generate and spawn pipes at regular intervals on the screen.
- Implement movement logic for pipes, ensuring they move from right to left and disappear once off-screen.
- Randomize the vertical gap position between pipes for varying difficulty.

### Step 7: Implement Collision Detection
- Set up collision detection logic to determine when the bird hits a pipe, the ground, or the screen's top.
- Use the game over state to halt game actions and display a game-over message upon collision.

### Step 8: Scoring System
- Develop a scoring system that increments the player's score each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe gap.
- Display the current score and track the highest session score on the screen.

### Step 9: Game States
- Define and manage different game states: "prestart," "running," and "game over."
- Implement state transitions, allowing the game to restart from "game over" to "prestart," resetting necessary elements.

### Step 10: Rendering and Animation
- Ensure all visual elements (background, pipes, bird, ground) are rendered correctly and updated in the game loop.
- Synchronize ground movement with pipes to emulate forward motion.

### Step 11: Input Handling
- Code input detection logic responding to taps, mouse clicks, or key presses to make the bird flap.
- Disable inputs during "game over" and "prestart" states except for starting or restarting the game.

### Step 12: Game Loop and Frame Rate Management
- Implement a game loop that manages updates for physics, input handling, collision checks, scoring, and rendering.
- Maintain a fixed frame rate for consistent game experience, using requestAnimationFrame or a similar approach.

### Step 13: Testing and Debugging
- Playtest extensively to identify bugs, performance issues, and areas needing additional polish.
- Debug identified issues and refine game mechanics for optimal player experience.

### Step 14: Deployment and Feedback
- Prepare the game for deployment (e.g., minifying assets, optimizing scripts).
- Choose a platform for publishing your game (such as itch.io, GitHub Pages).
- Collect player feedback and make further improvements as needed.

### Conclusion
- Continuously iterate on the game by implementing feedback and new features.
- Consider expanding the game mechanics once the core gameplay is solidified for enhanced player engagement.
